## Questions from Company
 - To check if strings are rotations of each other or not. And if they are in rotation print the no. of rotations. [Paytm Interview]
 - Find the string is panagram or not [Paytm Interview]
 - Minimum Meetroom scheduling [PhonePe]
 - Anagram Strings based question [PhonePe]
 - Implement findViewById method [Booking.com]
 - Given a list of words as input, output another list of strings, each containing words that are mutual anagrams [Booking.com]
 - Identify whether four sides (given by four integers) can form a square, a rectangle or neither [Booking.com]
 - Output a delta encoding for the sequence. In a delta encoding, the first element is reproduced as-is. Each subsequent element is represented as the numeric difference from the element before it [Booking.com]
 - Three integer arrays are given with duplicate numbers. Find the common elements among three arrays [Booking.com]
 - Twisted question related to ConcurrentModificationException in an ArrayList [Booking.com]
 - How do you implement a hotel list and detail screen. Discuss what all APIs You will create how the layout will be [Booking.com]
 - Fragments & their lifecycle, Activity lifecycle, Views, Layouts [Booking.com]
 - Background task in Android - Asynctask, service, intent services etc [Booking.com]
 - Given dates and number of check-in and check-out on those dates. Find the busiest day of the hotel. [Merge Array interval type question] [Booking.com]
 - given an array, determine if there are repeated elements. If an element is repeated more than 3 times, return those elements. This question is basically doing a hash and checking if the hash already exists. Someone used a Map and a Set. [Booking.com]
 - Given an list of positive words, negative words and a review, determine if the review is flagged as positive, negative or neutral. Someone solved it using a Set. Someone just needed to do some count (+ or -) regarding on where the word appeard (positive list or negative). [Booking.com]
