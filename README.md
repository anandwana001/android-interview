- What is recomposition? [Recomposition](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/mental-model#recomposition)
- **What is `remember` in compose?**
  - A composable function to remember the value produced by a calculation only at the time of composition. It will not calculate again in recomposition.
  - Recomposition will always return the value produced by composition.
  - Whole Compose is based on concept of `Positional Memoization`
  - At the time of recomosition, `remember` internally calls a function called `rememberedValue()` whose work is to look into the `slotTable` and compare if the previous value and the new value has any difference, if not return, else update value

- What are your thoughts on flat heirarchy, constraint Layout in compose vs the older view heirarchy in xml
- Difference b/w remember and LaunchedEffect
- Does re-composition of `ComposeItem1` bring any affect on `ComposeItem2`? If yes, then how? 
  - `ComposeParent() { ComposeItem1 {} ComposeItem2() {...} } `

If an element is repeated more than 3 times, return those elements. This question is basically doing a hash and checking if the hash already exists. Someone used a Map and a Set. </li> <li> Given an list of positive words, negative words and a review, determine if the review is flagged as positive, negative or neutral. Someone solved it using a Set. Someone just needed to do some count (+ or -) regarding on where the word appeard (positive list or negative). </li> </ul>|
